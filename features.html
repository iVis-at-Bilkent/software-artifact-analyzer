            <h1>Features</h1>
            <p>Software Artifact Analyzer (SAA) was designed to visually analyze a software's artifact traceability graph to
                gain insight into the development process and improve it <a href="#1">[1]</a>.</p>

            <h2>Initial artifact traceability graph of interest</h2>
            <div class="flex-container">
                <div class="flex_text_container">
                    <p>The user may initiate their analysis either through an issue tracking tool such as GitHub and Jira or directly
                        launch SAA and construct a query. A query might be an SQL-like query (e.g., all issues with a type of bug and
                        priority of equal) or a more advanced graph-based query (e.g., any files that developers all A, B and C
                        contributed to).
                    </p>
                    <p>This basically forms a "landing" artifact traceability graph of interest, which may be further extended
                        through additional queries or via context menus of artifacts in the graph.
                    </p>
                    <p>The context menus are specific to each node type, allowing users to perform operations tailored to that specific
                        software artifact or developer. For instance, one might be interested in finding <b>any source code files
                        modified by a particular pull request</b>, followed by <b>author(s) of the related commit</b> from the context menu of that pull request as exemplified below.
                    </p>
                </div>
                <div class="flex_text_img_separator"></div>
                <div class="flex_img_container">
                    <img src="assets/context-menus.gif" alt="Context Menu">
                </div>
            </div>
            <h2>Inspecting graph content</h2>
            <p>By selecting an artifact or developer or a relation among them, you may get detailed information about that entity
                or the relationship through object inspectors. When applicable, the inspector will link the artifact to associated
                any GitHub or Jira page.
                <img width="70%" src="assets/inspector.png" alt="Object Inspector">
            </p>

            <h2>Complexity management through grouping</h2>
            <p>SAA facilitates the grouping of nodes either manually or automatically based on topology or developers, 
                enhancing analysis and reducing complexity. Below is an example of a traceability graph grouped by developer.
            </p>

            <div>
            <img width="45%" src="assets/grouping-developer.gif" style="display:inline-block" alt="Grouping by Developer">
            <img width="6%" style="display:inline-block"/>
            <img width="45%" src="assets/grouping-louvain.gif" style="display:inline-block" alt="Grouping by Topology (Louvain Clustering)">
            </div>

            <p>SAA hosts some readily available software analytic methods described below to illustrate how such methods may be
                integrated into the framework quickly.
            </p>

            <h2>Reviewer recommendation</h2>
            <p>Utilizing the RSTrace+ algorithm <a href="#2">[2]</a>, SAA assists in making reviewer assignments, offering 
                a visual representation of analysis results to boost confidence in decision-making.
                <img width="70%" src="assets/reviewer-recommendation.png" alt="Reviewer Recommendation">
            </p>
            
            <p>Users can customize their view by choosing the number of recommendations to display and incorporating a recency
                factor for calculation. The table results furnish a list of recommended reviewers, each accompanied by their
                respective scores. The graph results provide the choice to display the graph either clustered by recommended 
                developers or not.
            </p>

            <h2>Expert recommendation</h2>
            <p>A similar technique to the RSTrace+ algorithm can also be used to identify experts or suitable developers on
                a specific source code file or a group of such files.
            </p>

            <h2>Bug tracking process anomaly detection</h2>
            <p>SAA detects a high number of types of bug-tracking process anomalies, as categorized by Qamar et al. 
                in <a href="#3">[3]</a>, contributing to process evaluation and anomaly prevention.
                <img width=70% src="assets/anomaly-detection.png" alt="Anomaly Detection">
            </p>
            <p>Visual cues on each issue aid in quickly identifying issues with higher number of anomalies, with the tooltips
                summarizing the type of anomalies detected.
            </p>
            
            <h2>Integration with issue tracking tools</h2> 
            <p>SAA allows users to report analysis results or observations directly on GitHub or Jira platforms, promoting seamless
                integration and practicality. Users can submit reports as comments under <i>pull requests</i> in GitHub or 
                as comments under <i>issues</i> in Jira, enhancing collaboration and communication.
                <img width=70% src="assets/reporting.png" alt="Report Component">
            </p>
            <p>This empowers developers with the ability to detect anomalies, make informed decisions, and collaborate effectively within the context of their software projects.</p>
